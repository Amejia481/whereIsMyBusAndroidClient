Where is my bus is tool that helps students to track where their school buses are in real time. This project is composed by three clients apps ([Android][android_client], [iOS][iOS_repo] and [Web mobile][web_app_repo]) and one [tracker app][android_tracker_repo]. Each school bus has a low-end android device with the [tracker app][android_tracker_repo] installed in it, every time the buses move 20 meters the app pushes the new location to a [real-time firebase database][firebase_docs_database] and notify all the clients that the position has changed. 

This is the home for the android client source code It is written using java. **We are open improvements**, if you like :heart_eyes: the app and  think that there is something  missing, or perhaps you want  improve something, just do it!. We are looking forward to hear from you.
